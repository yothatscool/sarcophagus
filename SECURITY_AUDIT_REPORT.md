## 🔍 Detailed Findings

### Strengths Identified
1. **Comprehensive Access Control**: Role-based permissions properly implemented
2. **Reentrancy Protection**: `nonReentrant` modifiers used consistently
3. **Input Validation**: Extensive validation for all user inputs
4. **Economic Safeguards**: Minimum deposits and rate limiting in place
5. **Emergency Controls**: Pause functionality working correctly
6. **Precision Handling**: Safe math operations throughout

### Minor Observations
1. **Rapid Deposits**: Contract allows multiple rapid deposits after initial minimum
   - **Impact**: LOW (intentional design)
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor for potential abuse

2. **Custom Error Matching**: Some test frameworks may not recognize custom errors
   - **Impact**: LOW (testing limitation, not security issue)
   - **Recommendation**: Use fallback revert testing

## 🛡️ Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Mainnet)
1. **Third-Party Audit**: Consider professional security audit
2. **Bug Bounty**: Implement bug bounty program

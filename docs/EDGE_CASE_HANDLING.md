# Edge Case Handling & Legal Considerations

## Overview

The Sarcophagus Protocol's enhanced beneficiary features are designed to handle complex real-world scenarios that traditional inheritance systems often struggle with. This document outlines the edge cases we've addressed and the legal considerations involved.

## 🚨 **Critical Edge Cases**

### **1. Simultaneous Death Scenarios**

#### **Problem Statement**
What happens when you and your primary beneficiary die in the same accident or within a very short time period?

#### **Traditional Issues**
- Inheritance may pass to unintended recipients
- Legal disputes over timing of deaths
- Assets may be lost or frozen

#### **Our Solution**
**Survivorship Periods:**
```solidity
uint256 survivorshipPeriod; // Days beneficiary must survive user
```

**Example Scenario:**
```
Timeline:
- Jan 1, 2025: You die in car accident
- Jan 2, 2025: Your spouse (primary beneficiary) dies from injuries
- Survivorship period: 30 days

Result: Inheritance passes to contingent beneficiary (your children)
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Check survivorship requirements
const [meetsRequirements, reason] = await contract.checkSurvivorshipRequirements(
  userAddress,
  beneficiaryIndex
);

if (!meetsRequirements) {
  console.log(`Beneficiary ineligible: ${reason}`);
  // Activate contingent beneficiary
}
```

### **2. Beneficiary Incapacity**

#### **Problem Statement**
What happens when a beneficiary becomes medically incapacitated and cannot manage their inheritance?

#### **Traditional Issues**
- Assets may be frozen
- Court-appointed guardians required
- Lengthy legal processes

#### **Our Solution**
**Incapacity Reporting System:**
```solidity
bool isIncapacitated; // Medical incapacity status
address guardian;     // Guardian for minors/incapacitated
address successorGuardian; // Backup guardian
```

**Process Flow:**
1. Medical authority reports incapacity
2. Guardian can claim inheritance on beneficiary's behalf
3. Successor guardian available if primary guardian unavailable

**Example:**
```javascript
// Report incapacity (verified medical authority)
await contract.reportBeneficiaryIncapacity(
  userAddress,
  beneficiaryIndex,
  true // isIncapacitated
);

// Guardian claims inheritance
await contract.claimInheritanceForMinor(
  userAddress,
  incapacitatedBeneficiary
);
```

### **3. All Beneficiaries Deceased**

#### **Problem Statement**
What happens when all designated beneficiaries die before you or are unable to inherit?

#### **Traditional Issues**
- Assets may be lost to the state
- Lengthy probate processes
- No clear distribution path

#### **Our Solution**
**Charity Fallback System:**
```solidity
mapping(address => address) public charityDesignations;
```

**Process:**
1. System detects no valid beneficiaries
2. Estate automatically transferred to designated charity
3. Prevents asset loss and ensures charitable giving

**Example:**
```javascript
// Designate charity
await contract.designateCharity('0xCharityAddress');

// Handle estate fallback
await contract.handleEstateFallback(userAddress);
```

### **4. Minor Beneficiaries**

#### **Problem Statement**
How to handle inheritance for children under 18 who cannot legally manage assets?

#### **Traditional Issues**
- Court-appointed guardians required
- Assets may be frozen until majority
- Complex legal requirements

#### **Our Solution**
**Comprehensive Guardian System:**
```solidity
bool isMinor;           // Under 18 status
address guardian;       // Primary guardian
address successorGuardian; // Backup guardian
```

**Requirements:**
- Guardian must be at least 21 years old
- Guardian cannot be the minor beneficiary
- Successor guardian recommended
- Guardian claims inheritance on minor's behalf

**Example:**
```javascript
// Create vault with minor beneficiary
await contract.createSarcophagusWithGuardians(
  ['0xMinorAddress'],     // beneficiary
  [10000],               // 100% percentage
  ['0xGuardianAddress'], // guardian
  [15]                   // age
);

// Guardian claims inheritance
await contract.claimInheritanceForMinor(
  userAddress,
  minorAddress
);
```

## ⚖️ **Legal Considerations**

### **1. Jurisdictional Compliance**

#### **Age of Majority**
- **United States:** 18 years (varies by state)
- **United Kingdom:** 18 years
- **Canada:** 18-19 years (varies by province)
- **Australia:** 18 years

**Implementation:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant MINOR_AGE_LIMIT = 18;
```

#### **Guardian Requirements**
- **Minimum Age:** 21 years (most jurisdictions)
- **Relationship Restrictions:** Varies by jurisdiction
- **Court Approval:** May be required in some cases

### **2. Survivorship Laws**

- **United States:** Varies by state (0-180 days)
- **Canada:** Varies by province

#### **Civil Law Jurisdictions**
- **France:** No automatic survivorship
- **Germany:** Specific time periods defined
- **Japan:** No automatic survivorship

**Our Implementation:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant DEFAULT_SURVIVORSHIP_PERIOD = 30 days;
uint256 public constant MAX_SURVIVORSHIP_PERIOD = 365 days;
```

### **3. Incapacity Laws**

#### **Medical Incapacity**
- **Definition:** Varies by jurisdiction
- **Reporting Authority:** Medical professionals
- **Duration:** May be temporary or permanent

#### **Legal Incapacity**

- **Reporting Requirements:** Annual reports required

#### **Donation Limits**
- **Percentage Limits:** May be capped
- **Tax Deductions:** Varies by jurisdiction

## 🔄 **Real-World Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Family with Minor Children**

**Setup:**
```
Vault Owner: John (45 years old)
Beneficiaries:
- Sarah (spouse, 40 years old, 60%)
- Emma (daughter, 12 years old, 25%)
- Michael (son, 8 years old, 15%)

Guardians:
- Sarah (guardian for Emma and Michael)
- David (brother, successor guardian)
```

**Edge Cases Handled:**
1. **Sarah dies before John:** Emma and Michael inherit Sarah's 60% + their own shares
2. **Sarah becomes incapacitated:** David becomes guardian, can claim inheritance
3. **All family members die:** Charity receives entire estate

### **Scenario 2: Complex Family Structure**

**Setup:**
```
Vault Owner: Margaret (70 years old)
Beneficiaries:
- Robert (son, 45 years old, 40%, survivorship: 30 days)
- Jennifer (daughter, 42 years old, 30%, survivorship: 60 days)
- Thomas (grandson, 20 years old, 20%, survivorship: 0 days)
- Lisa (granddaughter, 15 years old, 10%, guardian: Jennifer)

Contingent Beneficiaries:
- Robert → Lisa
- Jennifer → Thomas
- Thomas → Robert
- Lisa → Thomas
```

**Edge Cases Handled:**
1. **Robert dies 15 days after Margaret:** Lisa inherits Robert's 40%
2. **Jennifer becomes incapacitated:** Thomas inherits Jennifer's 30%
3. **Lisa is minor:** Jennifer (guardian) claims on her behalf

### **Scenario 3: No Family Members**

**Setup:**
```
Vault Owner: Patricia (80 years old)
Beneficiaries:
- None (all family deceased)
Charity: Red Cross
```

**Edge Cases Handled:**
1. **No valid beneficiaries:** Red Cross receives entire estate
2. **Automatic distribution:** No probate required
3. **Charitable giving:** Tax benefits for estate

## 🛡️ **Security Considerations**

### **1. Access Control**

#### **Role-Based Permissions**
```solidity
// Only verified sources can report status changes
function reportBeneficiaryDeath(
    address user,
    uint256 beneficiaryIndex,
    uint256 deathTimestamp
) external onlyRole(VERIFIER_ROLE)

function reportBeneficiaryIncapacity(
    address user,
    uint256 beneficiaryIndex,
    bool isIncapacitated
) external onlyRole(VERIFIER_ROLE)
```

#### **Verification Requirements**
- **Death Reports:** Require official documentation
- **Incapacity Reports:** Require medical certification
- **Guardian Claims:** Require legal documentation

### **2. Data Privacy**

#### **Personal Information**
- **Contact Info:** Stored as IPFS hash
- **Medical Data:** Not stored on-chain
- **Legal Documents:** Encrypted and decentralized

#### **Access Controls**
- **Beneficiary Data:** Only accessible to authorized parties
- **Status Information:** Role-based access
- **Audit Trails:** Complete transaction history

### **3. Fraud Prevention**

#### **Duplicate Claims**
```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public claimed;
```

#### **Invalid Status Changes**
- **Death Reports:** Cannot be reversed
- **Incapacity Reports:** Can be updated with medical evidence
- **Guardian Changes:** Require legal documentation

# Enhanced Beneficiary Features - Phase 1

## Overview

The Sarcophagus Protocol Phase 1 includes core beneficiary management features designed for secure digital inheritance planning. This phase focuses on legally sound, privacy-compliant inheritance distribution while maintaining the foundation for future enhancements.

## üèóÔ∏è **Phase 1 Core Features**

### **1. Basic Beneficiary Structure**

Each beneficiary includes essential configuration options:

```solidity
struct Beneficiary {
    address recipient;           // Primary beneficiary address
    uint256 percentage;          // Inheritance percentage (basis points)
    address guardian;            // Guardian for minor beneficiaries
    bool isMinor;               // Whether beneficiary is under 18
    uint256 age;                // Age at time of designation
    
    // Phase 2 features (future implementation)
    // address contingentBeneficiary;  // Backup beneficiary if primary dies
    // uint256 survivorshipPeriod;     // Days beneficiary must survive user
    // address successorGuardian;      // Backup guardian if primary guardian dies
    // string contactInfo;             // IPFS hash of contact details
}
```

### **2. Guardian Management**

**For Minor Beneficiaries (Under 18):**

**Primary Guardian:**
- Required for all beneficiaries under 18
- Must be at least 21 years old
- Cannot be the beneficiary themselves

**Example:**
```
Minor: Emma (age 12)
Primary Guardian: Sarah (mother)
```

### **3. Charity Fallback**

**Purpose:** Designate a charity to receive your estate if all beneficiaries are deceased or unable to claim.

**Configuration:**
- Optional charity address
- Receives entire estate if no valid beneficiaries exist
- Prevents assets from being lost or unclaimed

**Example:**
```
Charity: 0x1234... (Red Cross)
Scenario: All beneficiaries deceased/unable to claim
Result: Entire estate donated to Red Cross
```

### **4. Token Reward System**

**OBOL Tokens:**
- Earned for locking assets in vaults
- Base reward token for participation
- Distributed based on lock duration and amount

**B3TR Tokens:**
- Environmental rewards for carbon offset activities
- Earned for environmental impact contributions
- Separate from base inheritance rewards

## üîß **Smart Contract Functions**

### **Core Beneficiary Management**

```solidity
// Create sarcophagus with beneficiaries
function createSarcophagus(
    address[] calldata beneficiaries,
    uint256[] calldata percentages,
    address[] calldata guardians,
    uint256[] calldata ages
) external

// Designate charity for estate fallback
function designateCharity(address charityAddress) external

// Handle estate when no valid beneficiaries exist
function handleEstateFallback(address user) external nonReentrant
```

### **Inheritance Functions**

```solidity
// Claim inheritance for a beneficiary
function claimInheritance(
    address user,
    uint256 beneficiaryIndex
) external nonReentrant

// Verify user death and unlock inheritance
function verifyDeath(
    address user,
    uint256 deathTimestamp,
    uint256 age
) external onlyRole(VERIFIER_ROLE)
```

## üéØ **Phase 1 Edge Case Handling**

### **1. Minor Beneficiaries**

**Problem:** How to handle inheritance for children under 18?

**Solution:** Guardian management system.

**Process:**
1. Designate a guardian for each minor beneficiary
2. Guardian can claim inheritance on behalf of minor
3. Guardian must be at least 21 years old
4. Guardian cannot be the minor themselves

### **2. All Beneficiaries Unable to Claim**

**Problem:** What if all beneficiaries are deceased or unable to claim?

**Solution:** Charity fallback mechanism.

**Process:**
1. System detects no valid beneficiaries
2. Estate automatically transferred to designated charity
3. Prevents asset loss

### **3. Legal Compliance**

**Problem:** How to ensure legal recognition?

**Solution:** Focus on legally recognized inheritance structures.

**Features:**
- Standard beneficiary designation
- Guardian management for minors
- Charity fallback options
- Clear inheritance percentages

## üöÄ **Future Phases (Planned)**

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
- Contingent beneficiaries
- Survivorship periods

# Phase 1 Launch Summary - Sarcophagus Protocol

## Overview
Phase 1 of the Sarcophagus protocol focuses on core inheritance functionality with a time-locked withdrawal system, environmental rewards, and legally sound beneficiary management. This phase removes health tracking features to ensure compliance and reduce complexity.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Digital Inheritance Vault
- **Secure asset locking**: VET, VTHO, B3TR, and OBOL tokens
- **Beneficiary management**: Up to 5 beneficiaries with percentage allocations
- **Guardian system**: Automatic guardianship for minor beneficiaries (under 18)
- **Contingent beneficiaries**: Backup beneficiaries if primary beneficiaries die
- **Survivorship periods**: Legal requirement that beneficiaries survive the user for a specified period

### 2. Time-Locked Withdrawal System
- **No withdrawal for first 7 years**: Prevents gaming and ensures commitment
- **Partial withdrawal after 15 years**: Up to 30% with 35% penalty
- **Full withdrawal after 15 years**: All funds with 20% penalty
- **Emergency withdrawal after 7 years**: All funds with 90% penalty (for true emergencies)
- **Penalty collection**: All penalties collected by the protocol

### 3. Environmental Rewards (OBOL & B3TR)
- **OBOL tokens**: Earned for locking assets in vault
- **B3TR tokens**: Environmental rewards from DAO-controlled allocations
- **Weighted reward rates**: Long-term holders get better rates
- **Automatic distribution**: Rewards distributed based on lock duration and amount
- **DAO governance**: B3TR allocations controlled by Vebetter DAO voting

### 4. Death Verification System
- **Oracle-based verification**: Integration with death verification oracles
- **Proof-of-death**: Cryptographic proof of death events
- **Automatic inheritance**: Triggered by verified death events

### 5. Legal Framework Compliance
- **Survivorship periods**: Enforce legal requirements for beneficiary survival
- **Contingent beneficiaries**: Handle beneficiary predecease scenarios
- **Guardian management**: Proper guardianship for minors
- **Charity fallback**: Automatic donation if no valid beneficiaries

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
- **Sarcophagus.sol**: Main inheritance vault contract
- **OBOL.sol**: Environmental reward token
- **B3TRRewards.sol**: Environmental rewards distribution
- **DeathVerifier.sol**: Death verification oracle interface
- **MultiSigWallet.sol**: Administrative functions

### Frontend Features
- **Dashboard**: Overview of vault status and rewards
- **Vault Management**: Create and manage inheritance vaults
- **Beneficiary Management**: Add/remove beneficiaries and set survivorship periods
- **Withdrawal Manager**: Time-locked withdrawal interface with penalty warnings
- **Reward Tracking**: OBOL and B3TR reward monitoring

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **Role-based permissions**: Admin, verifier, and oracle roles
- **Circuit breaker**: Emergency pause functionality
- **Multi-signature admin**: Secure administrative functions

### Anti-Farming Measures
- **Minimum lock periods**: 30-day minimum for new vaults
- **Minimum deposits**: 100 VET minimum to prevent spam
- **Grandfathering deadline**: 90-day window for existing users

### Withdrawal Security
- **Time-locked irrevocability**: No early withdrawals to prevent gaming
- **Penalty system**: Discourages premature withdrawals
- **Emergency safeguards**: 90% penalty for emergency withdrawals

## Compliance & Legal

### Inheritance Law Compliance
- **Survivorship periods**: Enforce legal requirements
- **Contingent beneficiaries**: Handle beneficiary predecease
- **Guardian requirements**: Proper minor protection
- **Charity fallback**: Ensure assets don't become unclaimed

### Privacy & Data Protection
- **No health tracking**: Removed health monitoring features
- **Minimal data collection**: Only essential inheritance data
- **IPFS document storage**: Decentralized document management

## Economic Model

### Fee Structure
- **Inheritance fee**: 1% on inheritance distributions
- **OBOL withdrawal fee**: 0.5% on OBOL token withdrawals
- **Withdrawal penalties**: 20-90% based on timing and type

### Reward Distribution
- **OBOL rewards**: Based on locked value and duration
- **B3TR rewards**: Environmental impact rewards
- **Weighted rates**: Long-term holders receive better rates

## Tokenomics & Rewards

### OBOL Token (Inheritance Rewards)
- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000 OBOL
- **Initial Vesting**: 5,000,000 OBOL (5%) - Team/DAO controlled
- **Reward Pool**: 95,000,000 OBOL (95%) - For inheritance rewards
- **Earning Mechanics**:
  - Initial bonus: 5% of deposit value
  - Daily rewards: 0.1% daily rate
  - Long-term bonus: 0.15% daily rate after 1 year
- **Inheritance Distribution**: 
  - **Important**: Users must explicitly lock earned OBOL tokens in their vault using `lockObolTokens()`
  - Only locked OBOL tokens are distributed to beneficiaries upon inheritance
  - Users can choose to lock all, some, or none of their earned OBOL
  - Users can withdraw earned OBOL to their VeWorld wallet anytime
- **Supply Management**: Daily caps and rate decay ensure decades of sustainable distribution

### B3TR Token (Environmental Rewards)
- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000 B3TR
- **DAO-Controlled**: All allocations managed by community governance
- **Reward Categories**: Environmental awareness, protocol participation, emergency relief
- **Sustainability**: Rate adjustments and funding limits prevent rapid exhaustion

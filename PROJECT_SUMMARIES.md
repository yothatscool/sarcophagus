# Sarcophagus Protocol - Project Summaries

---

## 1. Technical Summary

### Protocol Architecture
- **Inheritance Vaults**: Users deposit VET, VTHO, B3TR, OBOL; designate beneficiaries, contingent heirs, charity fallback, and guardians for minors.
- **Multi-Oracle Death Verification**: 5 oracles (configurable), 3+ confirmations required, IPFS death certificate, survivorship enforcement.
- **MultiSig Governance**: 5 signers (weighted: 40/25/20/10/5), 60% required for actions, controls fee collector.
- **Fee Structure**: 1% inheritance transfer, 0.5% OBOL withdrawal, all routed to MultiSig.
- **Tokenomics**:
  - OBOL: 0.01% daily (3.65% APY), 0.015% daily (5.475% APY) after 1 year, time-based decay, vesting.
  - B3TR: Carbon offset and legacy bonuses based on age at death vs. life expectancy.
- **Security**: nonReentrant on all external calls, role-based access, circuit breaker, constants/immutables, all tests passing, Slither clean.

### Key Contracts
- `Sarcophagus.sol`: Vault logic, inheritance, fees, circuit breaker.
- `DeathVerifier.sol`: Oracle consensus, death verification, survivorship.
- `OBOL.sol`: Reward logic, vesting, APY, bonus, decay.
- `B3TRRewards.sol`: Environmental bonus logic.
- `MultiSigWallet.sol`: Weighted multi-sig, admin, emergency.

### Testing & Audit
- Full test suite (multi-beneficiary, minors, contingents, charity, edge cases).
- All oracles and MultiSig signers under your control for testnet.
- Slither: No critical vulnerabilities, only informational findings.

### Deployment
- Scripts ready for testnet/mainnet.
- Frontend config auto-updater.
- All addresses, oracles, MultiSig signers set.

## 2. Business-Focused Summary

### What is Sarcophagus?
A next-generation digital inheritance protocol for VeChain, enabling secure, automated transfer of crypto assets to loved ones, with built-in environmental and legacy incentives.

### Key Benefits
- **Peace of Mind**: Assets are automatically distributed to chosen beneficiaries upon verified death.
- **Security**: Multi-oracle and MultiSig governance prevent fraud and single-point-of-failure.
- **Transparency**: All fees, rewards, and distributions are on-chain and auditable.
- **Sustainability**: Environmental bonuses (B3TR) reward early carbon offset, legacy bonuses for longevity.
- **Flexibility**: Supports minors, guardians, contingent heirs, and charity fallback.

### Revenue & Incentives
- **Protocol Fees**: 1% inheritance, 0.5% OBOL withdrawal, routed to MultiSig (DAO or admin control).
- **Tokenomics**: OBOL rewards for participation, B3TR for environmental impact.
- **Long-Term Value**: Vesting, APY, and bonus rates encourage holding and protocol engagement.

### Launch Readiness
- All contracts, frontend, and scripts are ready for testnet launch.
- Full test scenarios and audit completed.
- Professional, secure, and future-proof.
